# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue, please do NOT send it over unencrypted communication such as Email. Instead, please contact us using matrix' encrypted private messages at `@nmkj:waah.day` or `@panosd:matrix.org`.

This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a bug report to the Codeberg repository.

Thanks for helping make Catodon safe for everyone.
